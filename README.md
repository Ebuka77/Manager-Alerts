# Manager-Alerts
Manager Alerts dashboard (Django + React) — simplified implementation of alerts filtering 

This is a junior-friendly full-stack project demonstrating a Manager Alerts system. It includes a Django backend (with SQLite seed data) and a React + TypeScript frontend.  
Users can view alerts for employees under a manager, filter by severity or name, toggle between direct and subtree reports, and dismiss alerts.  

The project implements many of the core features requested in the take-home test, with some simplifications.
